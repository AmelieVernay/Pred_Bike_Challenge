# HMMA238 - Bike challenge 2021

## Prediction part

This repository contains my work for an individual challenge based on bike traffic prediction in Montpellier, as part of my [HMMA238 course in 'Software devlopment'](https://github.com/bcharlier/HMMA238).

**NOTE** - My GitHub reposirory for the visualization part of the challenge can be founded [here](https://github.com/AmelieVernay/MtpBikeViz), and the final result of this visualization project is available [here](https://amelievernay.pythonanywhere.com/).

The goal was to predict the number of bicycle passing between 00:01 AM and 09:00 AM on Friday, April 2nd. My methodology is described in the `Vernay_Am√©lie_methodology.pdf` file in the `Methodology` folder.

## Repository architecture

* `Data`
    * `marchweekatnine.csv`: dataset used in `bad_pred_with_weather.ipynb`
    * `SaisiesTotem.csv`: `main dataset`
* `Methodology`: LaTeX files for `.pdf` report
* `Weather`
    * `init_weather.py`: initializes the weather dataset
    * `weather_update.py`: updates the weather dataset everyday
    * `bad_pred_with_weather.ipynb`: tests to find eventual links between weather and bike traffic (turns out to be irrelevent)
    * `lm_would_be_irrelevent.svg`: this image  is a visual proof that a linear model would be irrelevent here
    * `weather.csv`: dataset for "weather VS bike traffic" analysis
* `load_data.py`: class loading the main dataset
* `preprocess.py`: functions for data preprocessing
* `resamp_interp_test.ipynb`: notebook for testing the relevance of the my method
* `forecast.ipynb`: notebook for bike traffic behaviour analysis
